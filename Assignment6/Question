Ques.1. What are the assumptions of linear regression?
Ans.1. Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. It also assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), independence of observations, and normally distributed residuals. Additionally, multicollinearity among independent variables should be minimal.


Ques.2.When should you use logistic regression instead of linear regression?
Ans.2.Use logistic regression when the target variable is categorical, especially binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). Linear regression is not suitable for classification because it can predict values outside the range [0, 1], while logistic regression outputs probabilities. Logistic regression also models a decision boundary to separate classes.


Ques.3.What is the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression?
Ans.3.In logistic regression, each coefficient represents the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in the corresponding feature. A positive coefficient increases the likelihood of the positive class, while a negative coefficient decreases it. The exponentiated coefficient (e^Î²) gives the odds ratio.


Ques.4.What is the difference between sigmoid and softmax functions?
Ans.4.The sigmoid function maps a real-valued number to a probability between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification. The softmax function generalizes this to multi-class classification by converting a vector of scores into probabilities that sum to 1 across multiple classes. Sigmoid is used in logistic regression, while softmax is used in multinomial logistic regression.


Ques.5. Why is R-squared not suitable for evaluating logistic regression models?
Ans.5.R-squared measures how well continuous values fit a regression line, which doesn't apply to classification tasks. Logistic regression outputs probabilities and makes discrete predictions, so metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC are more appropriate. R-squared can be misleading in this context.
